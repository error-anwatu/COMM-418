<h1> COMM-418: Weekly Data Story </h1>

<p> This week I've chosen to talk about Bloomberg's article summarizing major events, changes, and evoluation in 2025 as depicted through various data visualizations. </p>
<p> The link to this article can be found here: https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-in-graphics/ </p>
<p> I suggest that everyone takes a minute to read through, or skim, because it's a great accumlation of work and how to incoporate different types of graphs in an article. </p>


<p> Last year many companies replicated Spotify's yearly recap of user's most listened to artists, genres, and songs; including Bloomberg. The linked article goes through some of Bloomberg's most memorable and informative stories during 2025. Bloomberg has divided these visualizations in several categories: Government & Policy, Wealth, Conflict, Markets & Finance, Technology, Health, Climate & Weather, Trade, Business, Elections, Energy & Commodities, and Cities.   </p>

<p> Each visualization opens a separate tab for the story that data belongs to. I thought this was a very creative way to archive work throughout the year and present it in a way that shows the variety of ways that data can be used. Additionally, it showed me the different types of data visualization you can use and how it impacts the weight of the story itself. </p>

<p> Bloomberg also linked to other data visualizations it's collected from previous years spanning from 2015 to 2024, with 2025 being the most recent collection.</p>
