<h4>Pew Research Center: What Makes People Proud of Their Country </h4>
<p>

For this week's data story, I chose a story from Pew Research Center. Pew Research Center is known for writing different types of stories using data and various data visualizations. This story is actually a report trying to answer the question, "What makes people proud of their country?" 
  
Pew surveyed more than 30,000 people across 25 countries: Argentine, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Poland, South Africa, South Korea, Spanish, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdon and the United States.

The organization's methodology sttes that the original responses to the questions were recorded directly and then professionally translated into English. I like that they included this detail upfront because it's important to be inclusive when collecting international data. More information on the questions, coding of the diferent topics, and the codebooked are linked in the appendixes at the bottom of the page.

The report is interactive allowing the user to select one of the 25 countries and view the agreggated response, and percentage of respondents within the country who answered similarly. For example, 21% of Nigerians surveyed said they were proud of their country's national resources like its oil supply and fertile soil for growing crops. In the United States, 22% of Americans surveyed said they were proud of their country's freedoms and liberties such as being able to pursue the "American Dream" or having access to opportunities that allowed for economic and social mobility.
