<h2> Assignment 4.2</h2>
<h4> Creating Your Own Dataset</h4>

<p>
<em><strong>The question you're curious about, and specifics on how this data could lead to a story addressing
that question. Pretend you're trying to convince your editor that you should get to spend time on this.</strong></em><br>

In honor of Superbowl Sunday, I would want to do a story comparing how many people were focused on the sports part, versus how many people were waiting until Bad Bunny's Halftime show. Socially, I feel that there's a better huge culture between watching the event for the sports portion, and watching the event for the enterntainment and marketing part of the show. Another intriguing aspect of this story is, through interviews, assessing people's anticipation for Bad Bunny, given his recent Grammy acceptance speech, his stance against ICE, and outspokenness about the uptick in violence toward Latino or Hispanic communities. This would make an interesting story because it's involving current political and cultural trends by using survey data and classic student reporting skills. <br>

<em><strong>What specifically do you want to know about the question? In other words, what data-points do you
want to collect?</strong></em><br>

I would need to collect data points about who's in favor of the Super Bowl being primarily focused on sports being the main focus of enterntainment vs the main focus being on the marketing and performance aspects. To add another layer of data collectio, you could choose to include the teams that people are rooting for or have potentially placed bets on.

<em><strong>How would you go about collecting the data? Would you need any particular permissions or
assistance from outsiders?</strong></em><br>

Ideally this would be a campus story, so I wouldn't need any permission from outside sources, unless I was using a data source that I found online would wanted to include some fancy acadmeic article that explained a niche research subject involving people's attention spans, a meta-commentary on the sports industry, or a deep-dive into the history of using sports events as one giant ad.

<em><strong>A table containing at least two and preferably five datapoints (rows) in this dataset. Either include as a markdown table
in your GitHub document (harder), or link to a Google spreadsheet (be sure to using the sharing link, not just the
document URL). If possible, collect it the way you would do so in a real project (survey some classmates, look up
documents, etc.) How you would go about getting the data, in some detail.</strong></em><br>
  
  I wasn't able to complete this part of the assignment.


<em><strong> A link to one or more sources where you expect to gather your data (if you don't plan to gather it by interviewing or direct
observation) — e.g., examples of media reports, websites, etc. Please make sure the data really are available at the links.</strong> </em><br>

Here are some sources that could be helpful when framing the article:
