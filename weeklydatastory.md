<h2> This is my submission for the Weekly Data Story Assignment</h2>

<p> I selected a story researched by the Pew Research Center analyzing the prescene of Catholicism in Latin American countries</p>

<p> The link can be found here: https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2026/01/21/catholicism-has-declined-in-latin-america-over-the-past-decade/</p>

<p> Culturally, this is a very important survey to have because Catholicism was a tool of colonialism in many Latin American and Caribbean countries.
Pew Research states that people still affirm their belief in God and honor the sacred nature of prayer, but are leaning away from traditional denominations.
Pew Research chose to analyze this phenomenon in the following countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colunbia, Mexico, and Peru. Pew chose these countries because
their combined population represents approximately three-quarters of the total population for Latin America and the Caribbean. </p>
