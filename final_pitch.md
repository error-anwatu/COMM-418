<h1> COMM-418: Final Story Pitch </h1>

<p> Pitch:

Using, Likitha Gedipudi's dataset tracking the evolution of GenZ slang and digital communication across various social media platforms, I intend to answer the following question, "How do slang terms relating to approval, emphasis, and insult show how we engage with certain parts of social media?"

I believe that this scope is manageable for a semester-long project, and I'll be able to supplement student-based reporting for areas that the raw dataset won't be able to cover. I intend to answer my question by using the term_category, term_meaning, origin_platform, and usage_platform as my main variables.

Slang is an informal language, however, it has the opportunity to reveal more about our psyche and perspective when critically reviewed, analyzed, and visualized. Digital-linguistic study is an important aspect of our society as we continue to evolve and become more reliant on the Internet and digital means of communicating with each other.
